# DB-Class-Generator

Problem - Creating classes for MySql database tables can be time consuming and repetitive. 

Solution - Creating a C# solution with CommunityToolkit.MVVM, WPF, MySqlConnector and Dapper to list tables and generate appropriate classes from the field names.

Note: This project is more of a pet project personally to re-explore coding in C# and seeing new technologies.
